# Migration strategies for IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers
{: #migration-strategies-power}

Learn how to migrate your data and workloads to a IBM&reg; Power Systems&trade; Virtual Server.
{: shortdesc}

## IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS)
{: #migration-icos}

COS can be used as an intermediary location to store files from your on-premises environment. You can retrieve and send your files to the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} environment from this location. You must create COS buckets to transfer data over the public internet and or privately secured links. For more information, see [IBM Cloud Object Storage: FAQ](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage/faq){: external}.

To copy data from COS to your AIX virtual machine (VM), you must install the [Amazon Web Services (AWS) CLI](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-aws-cli) by using either the **Yellowdog Updater, Modified (yum)** or **Pip installs Python pip (pip)** package managers. If you use the yum package manager, you can install the AWS CLI with the `yum install aws-cli` command. For the pip package manager, you can use `pip install awscli` to install the AWS CLI. After the installation, you can use the universal S3 commands that are supported by AWS to copy objects.

You can also find a script that ships (as a sample command) with AIX 7.2 TL3, or later, that simplifies the installation of yum, pip, and the AWS CLI. You can find the script at: `/usr/samples/nim/cloud_setup`.

- [Python for AIX](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/883796){: external}

For an IBM i VM, you must use the [Cloud Storage Solution for IBM i product (5733-ICC)](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-cloud-storage-solutions-i){: external} to communicate with COS and transfer data.

<!-- ## Mass Data Migration (MDM)
{: #migration-mdm}

MDM provides a simple and secure way to physically transfer data (terabytes to petabytes) to the IBM Cloud Object Storage to be used by {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}. As part of the MDM process, IBM sends the client an MDM-approved device, who uploads their on-premises data to the device and sends it back. IBM then transfers and stores the content in COS for later retrieval from within the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} environment. To learn more, see [Mass Data Migration: FAQ](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/mass-data-migration/faq){: external}.

The data transfer rate for MDM on an IBM i system is roughly 110-120 MB/sec. It takes between 2.5 and 3 hours to successfully transfer 1 TB of data.
{: note}

For steps to configure MDM on AIX and IBM i VMs, see the following tutorials:
- [Configuring IBM Cloud Mass Data Migration (MDM) on AIX VM](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-configuring-mdm)
- [Configuring Mass Data Migration (MDM) on IBM i VM](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-configuring-mass-data-migration-mdm-on-ibm-i-vm) -->
<!-- Removed MDM topic as per Mark Martin's input. -->

## PowerVC images and COS
{: #migration-powervc-icos}

If you have an environment with access to PowerVC, you can capture OVA images to easily migrate your data. The {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} offering allows you to provision a new virtual server based on an OVA image. To accomplish this, regardless of the operating system (OS), you must complete the following steps:

1. Create an OVA image on your local system.
2. Copy the OVA image to your **Cloud Object Storage** account.
3. [Deploy the OVA image and provision a new Power Systems Virtual Server](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-deploy-custom-image).

## Aspera Technologies
{: #aspera-technologies}

IBM Aspera&reg; on Cloud is a hosted service that quickly and reliably moves and shares your data sets across a hybrid cloud environment. IBM Aspera can help transfer data to the IBM Cloud for later retrieval from the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} environment. For more information, see [IBM Aspera on Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/products/aspera){: external}.

## Replication
{: #replication}

You can use various replication mechanisms to migrate and sync environments between your on-premises environment and the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}.

Storage area network (SAN) and hardware-based replication is not currently a migration option.
{: note}

### Host and OS-based logical replication
{: #replication-host}

IBM recommends that you use PowerHA SystemMirror (Enterprise Edition) with Geographic Mirroring (Geomirroring) and Geographic Logical Volume Manager (GLVM). The following host and os-based logical replication options exist depending on your OS:

- **AIX** - GLVM
- **IBM i** - Geomirroring

### Application-specific replication
{: #replication-app}

Applications might have replication mechanisms that can sync multiple environments. These options are commonly used for application-specific replication:

- *Db2 HADR*
- *Oracle Data Guard*
- *Oracle Goldengate*
- *iCluster*
- *MIMIX from Syncsort*
- *Maxava HA*

## Backup and restore
{: #backup-restore}

You can back up your on-premises environment and restore it to {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}. In most cases, COS, and NFS servers serve as an intermediary to back up and restore data. The [AIX migration strategies](#migration-aix) and [IBM i migration strategies](#migration-ibmi) sections provide information on OS-specific migration strategies.

## Third-party vendors and tools
{: #third-party-vendors}

Customers can use third-party tools to perform data migration. The following third-party tools are commonly used for data migration:

- [*Falconstor StorSafe VTL*](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-migration-strategies-power#falconstor-storsafe-vtl)
- *iCluster*
- *MIMIX from Syncsort*
- *Double-Take® MoveTM for AIX*
- *Maxava HA*

### FalconStor StorSafe VTL
{: storsafe-vtl}

StorSafe VTL is an IBM-certified solution for migration, backup optimization, archive and data recovery (DR). 

StorSafe VTL is software that emulates physical tape drives and libraries to optimize backup and recovery both on-premises and in the cloud, as well as enable simple and easy migration from on-premises to {{site.data.keyword.powerSysFull}}. StorSafe VTL can backup IBM i or AIX workloads on-premises, replicate to a cloud-resident StorSafe VTL, and then restore to a {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}. Legacy tapes can be handled similarly. Here are some of the features of StorSafe VTL:

- Non-disruptive and secure process that can scale to PB-sized workloads.
- Deduplication & replication improves performance and reduces storage capacity.
- The same tool for on-premise and cloud that enables both workload and tape migrations.
- System and application data is deduplicated and compressed before transmitting over the network, thereby accelerating migration, even on the initial baseline transfer.
- Replicated tapes land in Cloud Object Storage (COS) and can be used by the cloud VTL as a backup baseline without copying the data.
- Migration leverages existing backup processes and tools leveraging existing environment and knowledge. 
- Data replication can occur over time as part of the backups with final sync replication completed fast during regular backup windows.
- FalconStor StorSafe VTL for {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} can take advantage of IBM low-cost COS storage for its repository.

### Migration by using MKSYSB
{: #migration-mksysb}

You can migrate your data by using the `mksysb` command:

1. Back up the on-premises OS with the `alt_disk_mksysb` command and transfer it to COS.
2. Create a {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} and import the image.
3. Restore the on-premises image.

For more information, see [Restoring an AIX mksysb image onto a Power Systems Virtual Server instance](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-restoring-aix-mksysb-image).

### Logical replication with GLVM and PowerHA SystemMirror for AIX Enterprise Edition
{: #logical-replication}

GLVM is an OS-based IP replication strategy. It is based on the AIX LVM and enables data and logical volume mirroring across geographically distant locations. GLVM supports both synchronous and asynchronous modes. You can integrate PowerHA SystemMirror (Enterprise Edition) for network monitoring and automated failover support.

### Alternative AIX migration strategies
{: #migration-alternative-aix}

Some alternative AIX migration strategies include:

- `rsync` for non-database files
- The `savevg` and `restvg` AIX commands
- Log shipping for databases

For a complete tutorial on migrating your AIX workloads to Power Systems Virtual Servers, see [Migrating AIX to IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/downloads/power-iaas-tutorials/PowerVS_AIX_Migration_Tutorial_v1.pdf){: external}.

### Migrating from AIX 7.1 to higher versions
{: #migration-aix-versions}

To migrate your resources from AIX 7.1 to higher AIX versions within Power Systems Virtual Servers, you must use the network boot option. Migration requires the VM to boot from the operating systems kernel level you are migrating to. To accomplish this, you need to configure the NIM (network boot) server. To define the NIM server with resources required for migration, complete the following steps:

1. Define the VM as a NIM master. For more information, see [Setting up a Network Installation Management (NIM) server](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-provisioning-nim).
2. Create a License Program Products (LPP) source by using an image repository that contains the images. Stock images already contain the ISO and LPPs that are found on the base media, so create the LPP source and NIM resources from [Installing optional software products from the AIX stock image](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-using-ess-iso#installing-aix-stock-image).
3. Customize any additional installation resources.
4. Define the AIX 7.1 VM as a NIM client.
5. Perform the installation for NIM migration.

For more information on creating and defining a NIM master, setting an LPP source and spot, see [Migrating from AIX 7.1](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/downloads/power-iaas/Migration_from_AIX7_1.pdf){: external}.

## IBM i migration strategies
{: #migration-ibmi}

Learn about migration strategies that are specific to IBM i systems.

### Backup Recovery and Media Services (BRMS) and Cloud Storage (ICC)
{: #ibmi-brms-icc}

Image catalogs are created out of objects that are backed up by using optical devices. These catalogs must be restored on the Power Systems Virtual Server instance by using some of the migration strategies, such as COS, Aspera, and NFS server. BRMS is an IBM i product that can be used to automate activities that help define and process your backup, recovery, and media management operations. The ICC product can be integrated with BRMS to move and retrieve objects from remote locations, including COS.

The following steps detail how to migrate your OS and data from an on-premises system to the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} environment. Keep in mind that most of these steps can be automated by using BRMS and ICC.

1. Create your IBM i VM in the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}.
2. Create a virtual tape and *IMGCLG* on the deployed VM.
3. Create a virtual tape and *IMGCLG* on the on-premises system and perform an operating system save by entering, `GO LICPGM Option 40`.
4. Transfer or FTP the images to the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}.

    You can accomplish the transfer by using some of the listed migration strategies (COS, Aspera, etc.).
    {: important}

5. Restore or slip the installation of the OS to get the base OS to the same level as it was on your on-premises system.
6. Migrate your remaining data.

For more information, see [Data backup and recovery by using BRMS and IBM Cloud Storage Solutions for i](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_ibm_i_74/rzai8/rzai8backupandrecoveryusingBRMSandICC.htm){: external} and [BRMS with Cloud Storage Solutions for i considerations and requirements](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_ibm_i_74/rzai8/rzai8brmscloudrequireandconsider.htm){: external}.

# Migration strategies for IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}
{: #migration-strategies-power}

Learn how to migrate your data and workloads to a {{site.data.keyword.powerSysFull}}.
{: shortdesc}


## IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS)
{: #migration-icos}

COS can be used as an intermediary location to store files from your private cloud environment. You can retrieve and send your files to the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} environment from this location. You must create COS buckets to transfer data over the public internet and or privately secured links. For more information, see [IBM Cloud Object Storage: FAQ](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage/faq){: external}.

[On-Premises]{: tag-red} You can transfer data from your private cloud data center to IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} Private Cloud operating systems, such as AIX, through client data network(s).
{: note}

To copy data from COS to your AIX virtual machine (VM), you must install the [Amazon Web Services (AWS) CLI](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-aws-cli) by using either the **Yellowdog Updater, Modified (yum)** or **Pip installs Python pip (pip)** package managers. If you use the yum package manager, you can install the AWS CLI with the `yum install aws-cli` command. For the pip package manager, you can use `pip install awscli` to install the AWS CLI. After the installation, you can use the universal S3 commands that are supported by AWS to copy objects.

You can also find a script that ships (as a sample command) with AIX 7.2 TL3, or later, that simplifies the installation of yum, pip, and the AWS CLI. You can find the script at: `/usr/samples/nim/cloud_setup`.

- [AIX Toolbox for Open Source Software](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/883796){: external}

<!--earlier the display name was Python for AIX.-->

For an IBM i VM, you must use the [Cloud Storage Solution for IBM i product (5733-ICC)](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-cloud-storage-solutions-i){: external} to communicate with COS and transfer data.

<!--### Mass Data Migration (MDM)
{: #migration-mdm}

MDM provides a simple and secure way to physically transfer data (terabytes to petabytes) to the IBM Cloud Object Storage to be used by {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}. As part of the MDM process, IBM sends the client an MDM-approved device, who uploads their private cloud data to the device and sends it back. IBM then transfers and stores the content in COS for later retrieval from within the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} environment. To learn more, see [Mass Data Migration: FAQ](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/mass-data-migration/faq){: external}.

The data transfer rate for MDM on an IBM i system is roughly 110-120 MB/sec. It takes between 2.5 and 3 hours to successfully transfer 1 TB of data.
{: note}

For steps to configure MDM on AIX and IBM i VMs, see the following tutorials:
- [Configuring IBM Cloud Mass Data Migration (MDM) on AIX VM](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-configuring-mdm)
- [Configuring Mass Data Migration (MDM) on IBM i VM](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-configuring-mass-data-migration-mdm-on-ibm-i-vm) -->

<!-- To Sandhya: this complete MDM topic have been removed from powerVS dated 22 Aug 2023, determine if the below 2 paras are required. If not delete the entire MDM section. -->
<!-- Removed MDM topic as per Mark Martin's input. -->

<!--[On-Premises]{: tag-red}

You can perform mass data migration specifically during initial phase of pod usage, backup and restore, or disaster recovery scenarios. However, you cannot use control plane network to move your application data from private cloud to the pod storage. Therefore, you must use client data network for this purpose. The primary options for migrating data into the pod client systems are as follows:

- Restoring data from the backup server over the client data network
- Replicating software (for example, SAP HANA) from a client source to the pod over the client data network-->

## PowerVC images and COS
{: #migration-powervc-icos}

If you have an environment with access to PowerVC, you can capture OVA images to easily migrate your data. The {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} offering allows you to provision a new virtual server based on an OVA image. To accomplish this, regardless of the operating system (OS), you must complete the following steps:

1. Create an OVA image on your local system.
2. Copy the OVA image to your **Cloud Object Storage** account.
3. [Deploying a custom image within a {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-deploy-custom-image).

## Aspera Technologies
{: #aspera-technologies}

IBM Aspera&reg; on Cloud is a hosted service that quickly and reliably moves and shares your data sets across a hybrid cloud environment. IBM Aspera can help transfer data to the IBM Cloud for later retrieval from the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} environment. For more information, see [IBM Aspera on Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/products/aspera){: external}.

Use the [Accelerated network transfer migration guide](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/downloads/power-iaas/accelerated_migration.pdf){: external} powered by Aspera to accelerate transferring your migration content directly into the workspace of your Power Virtual Server helping you to achieve faster time to value from IBM cloud.

## Replication
{: #replication}

You can use various replication mechanisms to migrate and sync environments between your private cloud environment and the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}.

Storage area network (SAN) and hardware-based replication is not currently a migration option.
{: note}

### Host and OS-based logical replication
{: #replication-host}

IBM recommends that you use PowerHA SystemMirror (Enterprise Edition) with Geographic Mirroring (Geomirroring) and Geographic Logical Volume Manager (GLVM). The following host and os-based logical replication options exist depending on your OS:

- **AIX** - GLVM
- **IBM i** - Geomirroring

### Application-specific replication
{: #replication-app}

Applications might have replication mechanisms that can sync multiple environments. These options are commonly used for application-specific replication:

- *Db2 HADR*
- *Oracle Data Guard*
- *Oracle Goldengate*
- *iCluster*
- *MIMIX from Syncsort*
- *Maxava HA*

## Backup and restore
{: #backup-restore}

You can back up your private cloud environment and restore it to {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}. In most cases, COS, and NFS servers serve as an intermediary to back up and restore data. The [AIX migration strategies](#migration-aix) and [IBM i migration strategies](#migration-ibmi) sections provide information on OS-specific migration strategies.

## Third-party vendors and tools
{: #third-party-vendors}

Customers can use third-party tools to perform data migration. The following third-party tools are commonly used for data migration:

- [*Falconstor StorSafe VTL*](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-migration-strategies-power#falconstor-storsafe-vtl)

### Migrating from AIX 7.1 to higher versions
{: #migration-aix-versions}

To migrate your resources from AIX 7.1 to higher AIX versions within {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}, you must use the network boot option. Migration requires the VM to boot from the operating systems kernel level you are migrating to. To accomplish this, you need to configure the NIM (network boot) server. To define the NIM server with resources required for migration, complete the following steps:

1. Define the VM as a NIM master. For more information, see [Setting up a Network Installation Management (NIM) server](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-provisioning-nim).
2. Create a License Program Products (LPP) source by using an image repository that contains the images. Stock images already contain the ISO and LPPs that are found on the base media, so create the LPP source and NIM resources from [Installing optional software products from the AIX stock image](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-using-ess-iso#installing-aix-stock-image).
3. Customize any additional installation resources.
4. Define the AIX 7.1 VM as a NIM client.
5. Perform the installation for NIM migration.

For more information on creating and defining a NIM master, setting an LPP source and spot, see [Migrating from AIX 7.1](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/downloads/power-iaas/Migration_from_AIX7_1.pdf){: external}.-->

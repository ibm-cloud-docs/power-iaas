{: #what-is-ppc}
{: faq}
{: support}

IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} Private Cloud is an as-a-service offering that includes a prescriptive set of physical infrastructure (compute, network, and storage). The infrastructure is deployed in your own data center. IBM site reliability engineers (SREs) fully maintain and operate your {{site.data.keyword.on-prem}} infrastructure and manage it through the IBM Cloud. Also, you can adjust your workloads by using pay-as-you-use billing. For more information, see [What is IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-about-power-iaas).

## Where can I find cost estimates for {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} infrastructure?
{: #estimate}
{: faq}

To generate an estimated price, use the [{{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} Estimate cost](https://cloud.ibm.com/power/estimate){: external} tool. For more information, see [Generating an estimate](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-generating-an-estimate). For other pricing-related questions for {{site.data.keyword.on-prem-fname}}, see [Pricing FAQs](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-pricing-private-cloud#faq).



## Can {{site.data.keyword.on-prem-fname}} in Client location pods be expanded with additional compute nodes?
{: #expand-pods}
{: faq}

Yes, you can add up to the maximum number of compute nodes for a specific configuration size. For example, you can start with 5 nodes and then add 3 more nodes.

## Can {{site.data.keyword.on-prem-fname}} in Client location pods be expanded with additional storage?
{: #expand-pods-storage}
{: faq}

Yes, you can expand the pod with additional storage capacity. But you cannot add more storage controllers.

## Are the {{site.data.keyword.on-prem-fname}} in Client location pods equipped with spare compute nodes for maintenance?
{: #spare-compute-node}
{: faq}

In each pod, one spare node is available that is exclusively usable for IBM operational purposes, such as to perform system maintenance. The system type of the spare node matches the largest client-usable node. For example, if you have a pod with 4X S1022 and 1X E1080 client-usable hosts, then the spare node is E1080.



## Where can I find the logs for the pod software or operator access logs?
{: #pod-logs}
{: faq}




As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the IBM Cloud Logs service to manage general purpose application logs, platform logs, or structured audit events. IBM Cloud Logs can be used with logs from both IBM Cloud services and customer applications. For more information, see [Getting started with IBM Cloud Logs](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-getting-started){: external}




## Will the pod disconnect from the IBM Cloud if there is an unplanned network outage?
{: #pod-disconnect-unplanned-nw-mcp}
{: faq}

If an unplanned network outage occurs for the management network that is connecting the IBM Cloud instance to the pod infrastructure, the VMs continue to run within the pod.

See Table 1 for the implications of a pod that is running in a disconnected mode due to an unplanned network outage. Also, the primary and secondary management connections (Direct Link or site-to-site VPN) to the IBM Cloud are lost.

If the stock images that are used to deploy the virtual machines are removed, the virtual machines can continue to operate without any issue. You are recommended to update the operating system by following the vendorâs guidelines specific to your operating system.

## What formats can I use to upload a custom image?
{: #custom-image}
{: faq}

Currently, you can import a custom image in the following formats: _.ova_, _.ova.gz_, _.tar_, _.tar.gz_ and _.tgz_.

## What storage types are available in the storage area network (SAN)?
{: #storage-faq}
{: faq}
{: support}

Each volume has a storage tier, which defines how many I/O operations per second (IOPS) can be started against that volume. These tiers can scale according to the size of the volume.

The following tiers are supported:
* Tier 0 (25 IOPS/GB)
* Tier 1 (10 IOPS per GB)
* Tier 3 (3 IOPS per GB)
* Fixed 5000 IOPS

If you find the storage tiers are over or under-provisioned, you can change the storage tier of an existing volume. For more information, see [Storage tiers](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-private-cloud-architecture#storage-tiers-spec-private-cloud).

## How do I extend my AIX rootvg?
{: #rootvg}
{: faq}

By default, the system deploys 20 GBs for the AIX _rootvg_. You can extend the AIX _rootvg_ by using the [extendvg](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_aix_72/e_commands/extendvg.html){: external} command to add a physical volume.

## What's the difference between shared capped and shared uncapped processor performance? How are they compared with dedicated processor performance?
{: #processor}
{: faq}

When you deploy a VM, you can choose between **Dedicated**, **Shared capped**, or **Shared uncapped** cores. The following list provides a simplified breakdown of their differences:

- **Shared uncapped**: shared among other clients
- **Shared capped**: shared, but resources do not expand beyond the requested capacity (used mostly for licensing)
- **Dedicated**: resources are allocated for a specific client (used for specific third-party considerations)

The core-to-virtual core ratio is 1:1. For shared processors, fractional cores round up to the nearest whole number. For example, 1.25 cores equal 2 virtual cores. For more information, see [How does shared processor performance compare to dedicated processors](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/power/blogs/pete-heyrman1/2020/06/16/how-does-shared-processor-performance-compare-to-d?CommunityKey=71e6bb8a-5b34-44da-be8b-277834a183b0&tab=recentcommunityblogsdashboard){: external}, [Pricing for {{site.data.keyword.on-prem-fname}}](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-pricing-private-cloud), and [Pricing for {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-pricing-virtual-server-on-cloud).

|Dedicated processors|
|:-----------------|
| The hypervisor makes a 1:1 binding between the processor of the partition and a physical processor core. After a VM is activated, the 1:1 binding is static. In the VM, the operating system (OS) logical thread runs on the physical processor core that is bound with the processor. With a dedicated processor partition, you must resize the number of cores to meet the **peak** demand of the partition. For example, on a typical workday, the CPU consumption is around four cores. But, because of the **peak** demand, the processor requires around eight cores. So, configure the partition with eight cores to handle the **peak** demand and avoid any queuing delays in dispatching the applications.|
{: class="simple-tab-table"}
{: tab-group="processor"}
{: caption="Dedicated processors" caption-side="top"}
{: #proc-table-1}
{: tab-title="Dedicated processors"}

|Shared processors|
|:-----------------|
| Shared processors have two sharing modes: capped or uncapped. For a capped partition, the amount of CPU time is capped to the value specified for the entitlement. For example, a capped partition with processing units set to 0.5, can use up to 30 seconds of CPU time every minute. For an uncapped partition, the number of virtual processors defines the upper-limit of CPU consumption and not the value that is specified for processing units. For example, if the number of virtual processors are set to 3, the partition can use up to 180 seconds of CPU time every minute (three virtual processors each running at 100% utilization are equivalent of three physical cores worth of CPU time). The server must have unused capacity available for a partition to use more than its configured processing units.|

## How does my current environment compare to what's available through the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}?
{: #performance}
{: faq}

If you like to compare your current environment's performance to what's available through the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} offering, see the [IBM Power Performance Report](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/K90RQOW8){: external}.

## How do I migrate my VM from one data center to another (WDC04 to DAL13)?
{: #vm-migration}
{: faq}

To migrate your VM from one data center to another, you must capture and export your VM to Cloud Object Storage. After you successfully capture and export your VM, copy it to the Cloud Object Storage in the destination region, then do an import followed by a deployment.

## What does VM pinning do?
{: #pinning}
{: faq}

You can choose a pinning policy: _soft pin_ or _hard pin_, to pin a VM to the host where it is running. When you _soft pin_ a VM for high availability, PowerVC automatically migrates the VM to the original host. The PowerVC is migrated when the host is back to its operating state. When you _hard pin_ a VM, the movement of the VM is restricted if the VM has a licensing restriction with the host. The VM movement is restricted during remote restart, automated remote restart, DRO, and live partition migration. The default pinning policy is _none_.

## What does it mean to set an affinity or anti-affinity rule?
{: #affinity}
{: faq}

You can apply affinity and anti-affinity policies to both VMs and volumes.

**VM affinity and anti-affinity policy** allow you to spread a group of VMs across different hosts or keep them on a specific host.

Volume affinity and anti-affinity policy allow you to control the placement of a new volume based on an existing PVM instance (VM) or volume. When you set an affinity policy for a new storage volume, the volume is created within the same storage provider as an existing PVM instance or volume. With an anti-affinity policy, the new volume is created in a different storage provider other than the storage provider the existing PVM instance or volume is located in.

The use of volume affinity policy (affinity or anti-affinity) requires the availability of multiple storage providers. You might experience the following errors when you use a volume affinity policy:

- If an additional storage provider is not available to fulfill the requested policy, you might receive an error. The error indicates the inability to locate a storage provider to create a volume by using the requested volume affinity policy.

- If additional storage providers exist but the storage providers do not have sufficient space to fulfill the requested policy, you might receive an error. The error indicates the inability to locate a storage provider with enough free capacity to satisfy the requested volume size.

## How to set a PVM instance to allow attaching mixed storage?
{: #mixed_storage}
{: faq}

You can now attach storage volumes to a PVM instance from different storage tiers and pools, other than the storage pool the PVM instance's root (boot) volume is deployed in. To attach storage volumes to a PVM, modify the PVM instance and set the _storagePoolAffinity_ property of the new PVM instance to false. By default, the _storagePoolAffinity_ property of the PVM instance is set to true when the PVM instance is deployed and can be changed only by using the modified PVM instance API. Attaching mixed storage to a PVM instance has implications on the PVM instance capture, clone, and snapshot features. For more information about modifying a PVM instance API, see [Modify PVM Instance](/apidocs/power-cloud#pcloud-pvminstances-put).

## Does IBM provide maintenance for the AIX, IBM i, or Linux operating systems?
{: #licensing-os}
{: faq}

No. It is the customer's responsibility to maintain, update, and manage the AIX, IBM i, or Linux operating system.

## How does licensing work for the AIX, IBM i, or Linux operating systems?
{: #os-support}
{: faq}

The license for the AIX and IBM i operating systems is part of the overall cost for the workspace. You cannot use an existing license that you already purchased. Refer to the AIX section to learn how to [create an AIX VM](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-create-vm).

You can use the movable IBM i (IBM i MOL) to move your existing on premises entitlements to {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}. Contact support to know more about the IBM i MOL, see [Getting help and support](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-getting-help-and-support).

{{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} supports multiple levels of RHEL and SLES. You can either use IBM provided stock Linux images with IBM Full Linux Subscription or bring your own custom Linux image with vendor-provided subscription.

For more information about supported versions of OS, see [What versions of AIX, IBM i, and Linux&reg; are supported?](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-powervs-faqs#os-versions).

## How does third-party licensing work?
{: #third-party}
{: faq}

Clients are responsible for third-party licensing.

## What are the hardware specifications?
{: #hardware-specs}
{: faq}
{: support}

For more information, see [Hardware specifications for {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-on-cloud-architecture#hardware-specifications-on-cloud) and [Hardware and software specifications for {{site.data.keyword.on-prem-fname}}](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-private-cloud-architecture#hardware-software-specs-private-cloud).

## Do {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} run in a multi-tenant environment?
{: #multi}
{: faq}

[{{site.data.keyword.off-prem}}]{: tag-blue}

## Are there bare-metal options?
{: #bare}
{: faq}

No, the bare-metal options are not available. The {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} offering focuses on virtual instances.

## Can you tell me more about the snapshotting, cloning, and restoring capabilities?
{: #snapshot}
{: faq}

{{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} provides the capability to capture full and point-in-time copies of entire logical volumes or data sets. Using IBM's _FlashCopy_ feature, the [{{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/power-cloud#introduction){: external} lets you create delta snapshots, volume clones, and restore your disks. To learn more, see [Snapshotting, cloning, and restoring](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-snapshots-cloning).

## What are the key differences between a snapshot and a clone?
{: #snap-vs-clone}
{: faq}

The key differences are as follows:

| Context | Snapshot | Clone |
|-|-|-|
| Definition | A snapshot is a thin-provisioned group of volumes that cannot be attached to a host or accessed or manipulated. | A clone is created from a snapshot and results in independent volumes which surface in the GUI and can be attached to hosts.|
| Primary function | Revert or restore the source disks to a desired state|Create a complete volume clone|
| Ease of creation | Easy and quick process| Three-step process and takes a long time|
| Pricing | Charged 30% of the regular storage rate| target volume storage plus the GRS costs|
{: caption="Differences between a snapshot and clone" caption-side="bottom"}


See [Snapshots, cloning, and restoring](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-snapshots-cloning) for more detailed information.

## Is there any UI to perform snapshot or clone operations?
{: #snap-clone-ui}

## Can you tell me more about the backup process by using the PowerHA Toolkit for IBM i?
{: #poweha-toolkit}
{: faq}

The PowerHA Toolkit for IBM i provides the 5250 user interfaces and automation to use them for backups. In a nutshell, it does the following tasks:
- Automates the memory flush
- Create the volumes-clone
- Attach the clones to a host
- Start the host
- Kick-off the backups
- Move the BRMS data back to the production VM and then shut down the backup VM
- Remove the cloned volumes

Using the PowerHA toolkit, you can create an intermediate snap-shot and a volumes-clone before the process enters the long-running volume detach or attach phase. You can pause the process immediately before the volumes are attached.

## How do I convert existing volumes to replication-enabled volumes?
{: #convert-to-replication-vol}
{: faq}

[{{site.data.keyword.off-prem}}]{: tag-blue}

You can retype the volume to toggle the `replicationEnable` flag of the volume by using [Perform an action on a Volume](/apidocs/power-cloud#pcloud-cloudinstances-volumes-action-post) request. This is possible only when the volume pool of existing volumes supports replication.

## How can I check whether volume is already replication enabled?
{: #check-for-replication-vol}
{: faq}

[{{site.data.keyword.off-prem}}]{: tag-blue}

You need to check the `replicationEnabled` attribute of the volume. A volume is replicationEnabled when it is true.

## How can I check whether a volume is a primary or an auxiliary volume?
{: #check-for-primary-vol}
{: faq}


[{{site.data.keyword.off-prem}}]{: tag-blue}

Volume is an auxiliary when `isAuxiliary` field of volume is true. When `replicationEnabled` is true and `isAuxiliary` is false then the volume is a primary volume.

{: faq}

Consider the following if you do not see an update in the User Interface(UI):

1. {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} uses a new caching mechanism for some resources to ensure that UI refresh operations complete in a timely manner.
2. In some scenarios out-dated information might be shown while the cache is updated, for approximately four minutes.
3. You can refresh the page to trigger an update to the cached data, eventually leading to the updated information's display.
4. When the DC has a heavy amount of traffic, and the cache is not refreshed within the last four minutes, {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} UI might display an error message. A subsequent page refresh retrieves and displays the updated information.

## Why canât I see the storage pool and tier of my boot images?
{: #stock-image-copy-improve}

## Can I use my own AIX, IBM i, or Linux image?
{: #image}
{: faq}
{: support}

Yes. This function is known as **bring your own image**. For more information, see [Deploying a custom image within a Power Systems Virtual Server](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-deploy-custom-image).

## What versions of stock images are available? 
{: #stock-images}
{: faq}
{: support}

Power Systems Virtual Server provides a stock image for each major version (example: Technology Level) of the operating system (OS) that is enabled through the offering. PowerVS typically provides stock images for the last three major versions of the supported OS. Any update to the OS stock image is planned only when the image level is certified for PowerVM&trade; environment.

## When are stock images removed from the catalog?
{: #remove-stock-images}
{: faq}
{: support}

Any unsupported and older stock images are periodically removed from the offering. You will be notified three weeks before the images are removed. 

## What happens to VMs deployed using stock images that are being removed?
{: #vm-stock-images}
{: faq}
{: support}

VMs deployed by using stock images that are being removed can continue to operate without any issues. You are recommended to follow operating system vendor’s guidelines to update the OS as needed. 

## What formats should I use when uploading a custom image?
{: #custom-image}
{: faq}

Currently, you can import a custom image in the following formats: _.ova_, _.ova.gz_, _.tar_, _.tar.gz_ and _.tgz_.

## What are the available storage types in the storage area network (SAN)?
{: #storage}
{: faq}
{: support}

All regions use **Tier 1** or **Tier 3** storage types. The **Tier 1** storage type is best for customers who require higher throughput. Customers who do not require exceptionally high throughput and are looking to minimize costs want to select **Tier 3**. The storage types cannot be changed once the volume is created. A VM cannot have disks from both storage types. For more information, see [Storage tiers](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-about-virtual-server#storage-tiers).

If you previously deployed a VM on an old storage type (**SSD** or **standard**), no action is required. Your VM continues to run by using the old storage type. You can also add new disks from those legacy tiers.

The boot image storage type is predefined and cannot be chosen.
{: note}

## How do I extend my AIX rootvg?
{: #rootvg}
{: faq}

By default, the system deploys 20 GBs for the AIX *rootvg*. You can extend the AIX *rootvg* by using the [extendvg](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_aix_72/e_commands/extendvg.html){: external} command to add a physical volume.

## What's the difference between capped and uncapped shared processor performance? How do they compare to dedicated processor performance?
{: #processor}
{: faq}

When deploying a VM, customers can choose between **dedicated**, **capped shared**, or **uncapped shared** processors for their virtual CPUs (vCPUs). The following list provides a simplified breakdown of their differences:

- **Dedicated**: resources are allocated for a specific client (used for specific third-party considerations)
- **Uncapped shared**: shared among other clients
- **Capped shared**: shared, but resources do not expand beyond those that are requested (used mostly for licensing)

There is a core-to-vCPU ratio of 1:1. For shared processors, fractional cores round up to the nearest whole number. For example, 1.25 cores equals 2 vCPUs. For more information, see [How does shared processor performance compare to dedicated processors](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/power/blogs/pete-heyrman1/2020/06/16/how-does-shared-processor-performance-compare-to-d?CommunityKey=71e6bb8a-5b34-44da-be8b-277834a183b0&tab=recentcommunityblogsdashboard){: external} and [Processor pricing](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-pricing-virtual-server#pricing-processor).

|Dedicated processors|
|:-----------------|
| The hypervisor makes a 1:1 binding of a partition’s processor to a physical processor core. Once a VM is activated, the 1:1 binding is static in that a given operating system (OS) logical thread will always run on that same physical hardware. With a dedicated processor partition, you need to size the wanted number of cores to meet the **peak** demand of the partition. For example, if during a typical workday the CPU consumption is around four cores, but it peaks around eight cores, you need to configure the partition with eight cores. Otherwise, you might encounter queuing delays in dispatching applications because there are not enough cores to handle the peak demand.|

{: tab-group="processor"}
{: caption="Table 1. Dedicated processors" caption-side="top"}
{: #proc-table-1}
{: tab-title="Dedicated processors"}

|Shared processors|
|:-----------------|
| For shared processors, there are two sharing modes: capped or uncapped. For a capped partition, the amount of CPU time is capped to the value specified for the entitlement. For example, the partition might consume at most 30 seconds of CPU time every minute for a capped partition with processing units set to 0.5. For an uncapped partition, the number of virtual processors defines the upper limit of CPU consumption and not the value that is specified for processing units. For example, if virtual processors are set to 3, the partition might consume 180 seconds of CPU time every minute (three virtual processors each running at 100% utilization would be three physical cores worth of CPU time). There must be unused capacity available on the server for a partition to consume more than its configured processing units.|

## How does my current environment compare to what's available through the Power Systems Virtual Server service?
{: #performance}
{: faq}

If you'd like to compare your current environment's performance to what's available through the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} offering, see the [IBM Power Systems Performance Report](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/K90RQOW8){: external}. For a more condensed comparison, see [IBM Power Systems CPW performance data comparison](https://www.itechsol.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IBM-Power-Systems-CPW-Performance-Data-Comparison-P7-vs-P8-vs-P9-rev3-July-2018.pdf){: external}.

## How do I migrate my VM from one data center to another (WDC04 to DAL13)?
{: #vm-migration}
{: faq}

To migrate your VM from one data center to another, you must capture and export your VM to Cloud Object Storage (COS). After you successfully capture and export your VM, copy it to the COS in the destination region, then perform an import followed by a deploy.

## What does VM pinning do?
{: #pinning}
{: faq}

You can choose to *soft pin* or *hard pin* a VM to the host where it is running. When you *soft pin* a VM for high availability, PowerVC automatically migrates the VM back to the original host once the host is back to its operating state. If the VM has a licensing restriction with the host, the *hard pin* option restricts the movement of the VM during remote restart, automated remote restart, DRO, and live partition migration. The default pinning policy is *none*.

## What does it mean to set an affinity or anti-affinity rule?
{: #affinity}
{: faq}

You can apply affinity and anti-affinity policies to both VMs and volumes.

**VM affinity and anti-affinity policy** allows you to spread a group of VMs across different hosts or keep them on a specific host.

Volume affinity and anti-affinity policy allow you to control the placement of a new volume based on an existing PVM instance (VM) or volume. When you set an affinity policy for a new storage volume, the volume is created within the same storage provider as an existing PVM instance or volume. With an anti-affinity policy, the new volume is created in a different storage provider other than the storage provider the existing PVM instance or volume is located in.

The use of volume affinity policy (affinity or anti-affinity) requires the availability of multiple storage providers. You might experience the following errors when you use a volume affinity policy:

- If an additional storage provider is not available to fulfill the requested policy, you might receive an error that indicates the inability to locate a storage provider to create a volume by using the requested volume affinity policy.

- If additional storage providers exist but the storage providers do not have sufficient space to fulfill the requested policy, you might receive an error that indicates the inability to locate a storage provider with enough free capacity to satisfy the requested volume size.

## How to set a PVM instance to allow attaching mixed storage?
{: #mixed_storage}
{: faq}

You can now attach storage volumes to a PVM instance from different storage tiers and pools, other than the storage pool the PVM instance's root (boot) volume is deployed in. To accomplish this you must modify the PVM instance and set the new PVM instance *storagePoolAffinity* property to false. The PVM instance *storagePoolAffinity* property is set to true by default when the PVM instance is deployed and can be changed only by using the modify PVM instance API. For more information about modifying a PVM instance API, see [Modify PVM Instance](/apidocs/power-cloud#pcloud-pvminstances-put). Attaching mixed storage to a PVM instance has implications on the PVM instance capture, clone, and snapshot features. See [Modify PVM Instance](/apidocs/power-cloud#pcloud-pvminstances-put) API for more details.

## Does IBM provide maintenance for the AIX, IBM i or Linux operating systems?
{: #licensing-os}
{: faq}

## How does licensing work for the AIX, IBM i, or Linux operating systems?
{: #os-support}
{: faq}

The license for the AIX and IBM i operating systems is part of the overall cost for the service. You cannot use an existing license that you already purchased. The {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} service does not provide Linux stock images. You must bring your own Linux image (OVA format) and subscription. RHEL and SLES OVA images are currently supported.

You can use the movable IBM i (IBM i MOL) to move your existing on premises entitlements to {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}. Contact support to know more about the IBM i MOL, see [Getting help and support](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-getting-help-and-support).

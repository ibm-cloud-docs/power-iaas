## What are the available storage types in the storage area network (SAN)?
{: #storage}
{: faq}
{: support}

Each volume has a storage tier, which defines how many I/O operations per second (IOPS) can be started against that volume. These tiers can scale according to the size of the volume.

The following tiers are supported:
* Tier 0 (25 IOPS/GB)
* Tier 1 (10 IOPS per GB)
* Tier 3 (3 IOPS per GB)
* Fixed 5000 IOPS

If you find the storage tiers are over or under-provisioned, you can change the storage tier of an existing volume. For more information, see [Storage tiers](/docs-draft/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-about-power-iaas#storage-tiers-spec-private-cloud).

## How do I extend my AIX rootvg?
{: #rootvg}
{: faq}

By default, the system deploys 20 GBs for the AIX *rootvg*. You can extend the AIX *rootvg* by using the [extendvg](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_aix_72/e_commands/extendvg.html){: external} command to add a physical volume.

## What's the difference between capped and uncapped shared processor performance? How do they compare to dedicated processor performance?
{: #processor}
{: faq}

When you deploy a VM, you can choose between **dedicated**, **capped shared**, or **uncapped shared** processors for your virtual CPUs (vCPUs). The following list provides a simplified breakdown of their differences:

- **Dedicated**: resources are allocated for a specific client (used for specific third-party considerations)
- **Uncapped shared**: shared among other clients
- **Capped shared**: shared, but resources do not expand beyond those that are requested (used mostly for licensing)

The core-to-vCPU ratio is 1:1. For shared processors, fractional cores round up to the nearest whole number. For example, 1.25 cores equals 2 vCPUs. For more information, see [How does shared processor performance compare to dedicated processors](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/power/blogs/pete-heyrman1/2020/06/16/how-does-shared-processor-performance-compare-to-d?CommunityKey=71e6bb8a-5b34-44da-be8b-277834a183b0&tab=recentcommunityblogsdashboard){: external}, [Pricing for IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} Private Cloud](/docs-draft/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-pricing-private-cloud)), and [Pricing for {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} on cloud](/docs-draft/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-pricing-virtual-server-on-cloud).

|Dedicated processors|
|:-----------------|
| The hypervisor makes a 1:1 binding of a partitionâs processor to a physical processor core. After a VM is activated, the 1:1 binding is static in that a given operating system (OS) logical thread will always run on that same physical hardware. With a dedicated processor partition, you need to size the wanted number of cores to meet the **peak** demand of the partition. For example, if during a typical workday the CPU consumption is around four cores, but it peaks around eight cores, you need to configure the partition with eight cores. Otherwise, you might encounter queuing delays in dispatching applications because there are not enough cores to handle the peak demand.|
{: class="simple-tab-table"}
{: tab-group="processor"}
{: caption="Table 1. Dedicated processors" caption-side="top"}
{: #proc-table-1}
{: tab-title="Dedicated processors"}

|Shared processors|
|:-----------------|
| For shared processors, there are two sharing modes: capped or uncapped. For a capped partition, the amount of CPU time is capped to the value specified for the entitlement. For example, the partition might consume at most 30 seconds of CPU time every minute for a capped partition with processing units set to 0.5. For an uncapped partition, the number of virtual processors defines the upper limit of CPU consumption and not the value that is specified for processing units. For example, if virtual processors are set to 3, the partition might consume 180 seconds of CPU time every minute (three virtual processors each running at 100% utilization would be three physical cores worth of CPU time). There must be unused capacity available on the server for a partition to consume more than its configured processing units.|
{: class="simple-tab-table"}
{: tab-group="processor"}
{: caption="Table 2. Shared processors" caption-side="top"}
{: #proc-table-2}
{: tab-title="Shared processors"}


<!--**Example 1**
Maximum Pool Capacity: 8
AIX VM1 VP: 4
AIX VM2 VP: 2

In this example, the maximum pool capacity (8) is greater than the total number of VPs associated with the partitions in a SPP (4+2=6). Therefore, the pricing for OS licensing is calculated as follows:
* The partition VM1 contains four VPs of AIX OS license. So, the price is four times the cost of AIX OS license.
* The partition VM2 contains two VPs of AIX OS license. So, the price is two times the cost of AIX OS license.

Therefore, the total cost for this SPP is six times the cost of AIX.

**Example 2**
Maximum Pool Capacity: 8
AIX VM1 VP: 4
AIX VM2 VP: 2
AIX VM3 VP: 4

In this example, the maximum pool capacity (8) is less than the total number of of VPs associated with the partitions in a SPP (4+2+4=10). Therefore, the pricing for OS licensing is distributed proportionately for all the VPs.
* VM1 is charged with 3.2 times the AIX OS license cost.
* VM2 is charged with 1.6 times the AIX OS license cost.
* VM3 is charged with 3.2 times the AIX OS license cost.-->


## How does my current environment compare to what's available through the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}?
{: #performance}
{: faq}

If you like to compare your current environment's performance to what's available through the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} offering, see the [IBM Power Performance Report](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/K90RQOW8){: external}.

## How do I migrate my VM from one data center to another (WDC04 to DAL13)?
{: #vm-migration}
{: faq}

To migrate your VM from one data center to another, you must capture and export your VM to Cloud Object Storage (COS). After you successfully capture and export your VM, copy it to the COS in the destination region, then perform an import followed by a deployment.

## What does VM pinning do?
{: #pinning}
{: faq}

You can choose to *soft pin* or *hard pin* a VM to the host where it is running. When you *soft pin* a VM for high availability, PowerVC automatically migrates the VM back to the original host once the host is back to its operating state. If the VM has a licensing restriction with the host, the *hard pin* option restricts the movement of the VM during remote restart, automated remote restart, DRO, and live partition migration. The default pinning policy is *none*.

## What does it mean to set an affinity or anti-affinity rule?
{: #affinity}
{: faq}

You can apply affinity and anti-affinity policies to both VMs and volumes.

**VM affinity and anti-affinity policy** allows you to spread a group of VMs across different hosts or keep them on a specific host.

Volume affinity and anti-affinity policy allow you to control the placement of a new volume based on an existing PVM instance (VM) or volume. When you set an affinity policy for a new storage volume, the volume is created within the same storage provider as an existing PVM instance or volume. With an anti-affinity policy, the new volume is created in a different storage provider other than the storage provider the existing PVM instance or volume is located in.

The use of volume affinity policy (affinity or anti-affinity) requires the availability of multiple storage providers. You might experience the following errors when you use a volume affinity policy:

- If an additional storage provider is not available to fulfill the requested policy, you might receive an error. The error indicates the inability to locate a storage provider to create a volume by using the requested volume affinity policy.

- If additional storage providers exist but the storage providers do not have sufficient space to fulfill the requested policy, you might receive an error. The error indicates the inability to locate a storage provider with enough free capacity to satisfy the requested volume size.

## How to set a PVM instance to allow attaching mixed storage?
{: #mixed_storage}
{: faq}

You can now attach storage volumes to a PVM instance from different storage tiers and pools, other than the storage pool the PVM instance's root (boot) volume is deployed in. To accomplish this, you must modify the PVM instance and set the new PVM instance *storagePoolAffinity* property to false. The PVM instance *storagePoolAffinity* property is set to true by default when the PVM instance is deployed and can be changed only by using the modify PVM instance API. Attaching mixed storage to a PVM instance has implications on the PVM instance capture, clone, and snapshot features. For more information about modifying a PVM instance API, see [Modify PVM Instance](/apidocs/power-cloud#pcloud-pvminstances-put).

## Does IBM provide maintenance for the AIX, IBM i, or Linux operating systems?
{: #licensing-os}

## Can you tell me more about the backup process using the PowerHA Toolkit for IBM i?
{: #poweha-toolkit}
{: faq}

The PowerHA Toolkit for IBM i provides the 5250 user interfaces and automation to use them for backups. In a nutshell, it does the following tasks:
- Automates the memory flush
- Create the volumes-clone
- Attach the clones to a host
- Start the host
- kicki-off the backups
- Move the BRMS data back to the production VM before shutting down the backup VM
- Remove the cloned volumes.

It also allows you to quickly create an intermediate snap-shot then a volumes-clone before entering the long-running volume detach or attach phase. You can pause the process immediately before attaching volumes.

## How do I convert existing volumes to replication enabled volumes?
{: #convert-to-replication-vol}
{: faq}

[Off-Premises]{: tag-blue}

You can retype the volume to toggle the `replicationEnable` flag of the volume by using [Perform an action on a Volume](/apidocs/power-cloud#pcloud-cloudinstances-volumes-action-post) request. This is possible only when the volume pool of existing volume supports replication.

## How can I check whether volume is already replication enabled?
{: #check-for-replication-vol}
{: faq}

[Off-Premises]{: tag-blue}

You need to check the `replicationEnabled` attribute of the volume. A volume is replicationEnabled when it is true.

## How can I check whether a volume is a primary or an auxiliary volume?
{: #check-for-primary-vol}
{: faq}


[Off-Premises]{: tag-blue}

Volume is an auxiliary when `isAuxiliary` field of volume is true. When `replicationEnabled` is true and `isAuxiliary` is false then the volume is a primary volume.

## How can I check the serial number of my virtual server instance?
{: #check-serial-no}
{: faq}

The serial number is available after you deploy your virtual server instance and you can choose to display the serial number system value.

Pin the IBM i virtual server instances that use the IBM i licenses. If you do not pin the virtual server instances and request a migration to a different host, the serial numbers changes, and the IBM i license will not work.

## What should I do If I do not see the latest information in the UI?
{: #ui-not-updated}
{: faq}

Consider the following if you do not see an update in the User Interface(UI):

1. {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} utilizes a new caching mechanism for some resources to ensure that UI refresh operations complete in a timely manner.
2. In some scenarios out-dated information may be shown while the cache is updated, for approximately four minutes.
3. You can refresh the page to trigger an update to the cached data, eventually leading to the updated information's display.
4. When the DC has a heavy amount of traffic, and the cache is not refreshed within the last four minutes, {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} UI may display an error message. A subsequent page refresh retrieves and displays the updated information.

## Why canât I see the storage pool and tier of my boot images?
{: #stock-image-copy-improve}
{: faq}

IBM improved the performance of copying a stock image into customers' accounts. As a result of this new feature, the newly copied stock image acts like an image reference, where volumes are not accessible to the user. The improved process now offers:
1.  Faster copy of stock image to your private project.
2.  The stock image cannot be exported. One can do VM capture and export on a deployed VM that uses the stock image.
3.  Storage pool and tier of a stock image shows "Empty" (API) or "Any" (UI) as VM can be deployed to any tier or pool by using the stock image.

## Can I select a specific resource group when I create a cloud connection?

## What is the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size that is supported in {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} networks?
{: #mtu-max}
{: faq}

The {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} supports a smaller MTU size of 1476 bytes for the public network interfaces and for the private network interfaces that are attached to a {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} VPN.

## Can I automate the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) configuration?
{: #mtu-config}
{: faq}

Yes, you can automate the network configurations such as the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU).

To automate the MTU configuration, you need to customize your cloud-init network configuration. For more information, see the [Cloud-init docs on network configuration](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/network-config-format-v1.html){: external}.

Both AIX and IBM i support custom cloud-init configurations at the time of {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} instance (VM) deployment.

You can customize the cloud-init configurations only through the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} API. The custom cloud-init is specified by the `userData` request parameter. For more information, see [Create a new Power VM Instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/power-cloud#pcloud-pvminstances-post).

[On-Premises]{: tag-red} The automation of MTU is not supported. The admin must update the MTU value on the virtual machine manually.

## Can I add user interface to an existing virtual machine?
{: #ui-vm}

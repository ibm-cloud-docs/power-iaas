* An electrical outlet that is not correctly wired could place hazardous voltage on the metal parts of the system or the devices that attach to the system. It is the responsibility of the customer to ensure that the outlet is correctly wired and grounded to prevent an electrical shock.


**(R001 part 2 of 2):**

![CAUTION](./Safety-notice-icons/danger.png "CAUTION")

**CAUTION:**

* Do not install a unit in a rack where the internal rack ambient temperatures will exceed the manufacturer's recommended ambient temperature for all your rack-mounted devices.
* Do not install a unit in a rack where the air flow is compromised. Ensure that air flow is not blocked or reduced on any side, front, or back of a unit used for air flow through the unit.
* Consideration should be given to the connection of the equipment to the supply circuit so that overloading of the circuits does not compromise the supply wiring or overcurrent protection. To provide the correct power connection to a rack, refer to the rating labels located on the equipment in the rack to determine the total power requirement of the supply circuit.
* (For sliding drawers.) Do not pull out or install any drawer or feature if the rack stabilizer brackets are not attached to the rack or if the rack is not bolted to the floor. Do not pull out more than one drawer at a time. The rack might become unstable if you pull out more than one drawer at a time.
* (For fixed drawers.) This drawer is a fixed drawer and must not be moved for servicing unless specified by the manufacturer. Attempting to move the drawer partially or completely out of the rack might cause the rack to become unstable or cause the drawer to fall out of the rack.


![CAUTION](./Safety-notice-icons/danger.png "CAUTION")

**CAUTION:** Removing components from the upper positions in the rack cabinet improves rack stability during relocation. Follow these general guidelines whenever you relocate a populated rack cabinet within a room or building.


* Reduce the weight of the rack cabinet by removing equipment starting at the top of the rack cabinet. When possible, restore the rack cabinet to the configuration of the rack cabinet as you received it. If this configuration is not known, you must observe the following precautions:
    - Remove all devices in the 32U position (compliance ID RACK-001) or 22U (compliance ID RR001) and above.
    - Ensure that the heaviest devices are installed in the bottom of the rack cabinet.
    - Ensure that there are little-to-no empty U-levels between devices installed in the rack cabinet below the 32U (compliance ID RACK-001) or 22U (compliance ID RR001) level, unless the received configuration specifically allowed it.
* If the rack cabinet you are relocating is part of a suite of rack cabinets, detach the rack cabinet from the suite.
* If the rack cabinet you are relocating was supplied with removable outriggers they must be reinstalled before the cabinet is relocated.
* Inspect the route that you plan to take to eliminate potential hazards.
* Verify that the route that you choose can support the weight of the loaded rack cabinet. Refer to the documentation that comes with your rack cabinet for the weight of a loaded rack cabinet.
* Verify that all door openings are at least 760 x 230 mm (30 x 80 in.).
* Ensure that all devices, shelves, drawers, doors, and cables are secure.
* Ensure that the four leveling pads are raised to their highest position.
* Ensure that there is no stabilizer bracket installed on the rack cabinet during movement.
* Do not use a ramp inclined at more than 10 degrees.
* When the rack cabinet is in the new location, complete the following steps:
    - Lower the four leveling pads.
    - Install stabilizer brackets on the rack cabinet or in an earthquake environment bolt the rack to the floor.
    - If you removed any devices from the rack cabinet, repopulate the rack cabinet from the lowest position to the highest position.
* If a long-distance relocation is required, restore the rack cabinet to the configuration of the rack cabinet as you received it. Pack the rack cabinet in the original packaging material, or equivalent. Also lower the leveling pads to raise the casters off of the pallet and bolt the rack cabinet to the pallet. **(R002)**

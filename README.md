IBM® Power® Virtual Server on IBM Cloud uses the existing IBM Cloud platform to create Power virtual servers, also known as logical partitions (LPAR), that run on IBM Power Systems hardware with the PowerVM hypervisor.

The Power Virtual Servers are a form of infrastructure as a service (IaaS). With Power Virtual Server, you can quickly create and deploy one or multiple virtual servers that are running either the AIX or IBM i operating systems in a public cloud. After you provision the virtual server in the cloud, it is your responsibility to make sure that the AIX or IBM i operating system is secure.

Use the Power Virtual Server for a number of workload scenarios, including disaster recovery, development environments, and partial IT infrastructure moves. Power Virtual Server clients can stay competitive with the scaling of their infrastructure and remain flexible with their workload management and capacity both on- and off-premise. And since the infrastructure layer is identical, system administrators who run client-managed environment AIX, IBM i (available for on-cloud), or Linux systems today can use their same tools, workflows, and enhancements in the cloud.

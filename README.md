{{site.data.keyword.powerSysFull}} on the IBM Cloud uses the existing IBM Cloud platform to create {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}, also known as logical partitions (LPAR), that run on IBM Power Systems hardware with the PowerVM hypervisor.

The {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} are a form of infrastructure as a service (IaaS). With {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}, you can quickly create and deploy one or multiple virtual servers that are running either the AIX or IBM i operating systems in a public cloud. After you provision the virtual server in the cloud, it is your responsibility to make sure that the AIX or IBM i operating system is secure.

Use the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} for a number of workload scenarios, including disaster recovery, development environments, and partial IT infrastructure moves. {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} clients can stay competitive with the scaling of their infrastructure and remain flexible with their workload management and capacity both on- and off-premise. And since the infrastructure layer is identical, system administrators who run client-managed environment AIX, IBM i (available for on-cloud), or Linux systems today can use their same tools, workflows, and enhancements in the cloud.

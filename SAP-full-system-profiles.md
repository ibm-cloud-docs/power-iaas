[Q2-2024 update start]{: tag-teal}

SAP HANA profiles consume all or most of the sytem resources, hence referred to as 'full system profiles'. You can deploy SAP HANA using full system profiles on a S1022 system provided there are no virtual machines deployed on it.

There is no additional billing or metering for full system profiles. The virtual machines with full system profiles are metered against the SAP HANA profile family in the same manner as any other profile from the family. For example, a profile such as sh2-24x1900 is metered with the core and memory parts for the SH2 family with 24 cores and 1900 GB of memory.

For more information about pricing, see [Pricing for Power Virtual Servers](/docs-draft/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-pricing-virtual-server).

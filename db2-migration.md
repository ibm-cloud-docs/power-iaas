{{site.data.keyword.powerSysFull}} provides an excellent infrastructure and environment to relocate your Power on AIX assets to high performance virtual computing infrastructure.
{: shortdesc}

As a DB2 administrator or infrastructure architect you get the option to leverage Db2 backup/restore procedures and Db2 HADR database synchronization commands.

You can create an off-prem backup of your Db2 database for disaster recovery, or fully migrate your Db2 workload from on-premises to a Power Virtual Server environment in a safe and secure IBM datacenter, quickly and easily using common Db2 tools.

To perform migration, see [Migrating Db2 on AIX to {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/downloads/power-iaas/db2_migration.pdf){: external}.

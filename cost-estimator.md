# Getting started with the cost estimator tool
{: #cost-estimator}

Use the cost estimator tool in the home page of {{site.data.keyword.powerSysFull}} in IBM CloudÂ® to estimate the cost of resources before you deploy them. With the cost estimator tool, you can customize and determine the requirements that align with your business needs.

You do not need to be logged in to create an estimate.

Select a data center that suits your needs and use the cost estimator tool for:
1.	Creating an estimate of resources
2.	Updating an existing estimate
3.	Saving and sharing your estimate

## Creating an estimation of resources
{: #est-resources}

To create an estimate, perform the following steps:

You are not charged for creating an estimate. The resources that you estimate can be deployed only after a workspace creation.
{: note}

1.	Open the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} [home page](https://cloud.ibm.com/power/overview){: external} in the IBM Cloud console.
2.	Click **Estimate cost**.
3.	Select a data center from the **Location** drop-down menu.
4.	Select one resource from the following list and choose additional configurations as per your requirement:
    * Virtual server instance
    * Storage volume
    * Shared processor pool
    * VPN connection
    * Virtual tape library
    * Dedicated host
5.	On the right-side panel, click **Add to estimate** to review the configuration.
6.	If you are not logged in, choose **from catalog** in the **Add product to estimate** drop-down menu.
7.	Click **Save**.
8.	Click **View estimate** to view and to take actions on them.

You can choose from Tier 0, Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Fixed IOPs or a combination of these. tiers \n You cannot add a separate boot volume estimation. Hence, you should enter the storage volume considering the boot volumes and data volume that you might need.|

# Getting started with the cost estimator
{: cost-estimator}

Use the cost estimator in the {{site.data.keyword.powerSysFull}} home page in IBM CloudÂ® to estimate the cost of resources before deploying them. Using the cost estimator, you can customize and decide what you need that fit your business needs.

You do not need to be logged in to create an estimate.

Select a data center that suits your needs and use the cost estimator for:
1.	Creating an estimate of resources
2.	Updating an existing estimate
3.	Saving and sharing your estimate

## Creating an estimation of resources
{:est-resources}

To create an estimate, perform the following steps:

You are not charged for creating an estimate. The resources that you estimate can be deployed only after a workspace creation.
{: note}

1.	Open the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} [home page](https://cloud.ibm.com/power/overview){: external} in the IBM Cloud console.
2.	Click **Estimate cost**.
3.	Select a data center from the **Location** drop-down menu.
4.	Select one resource from the following list and choose more configurations as per your requirement to create an estimate before deploying them:
    * Virtual server instance
    * Storage volume
    * Shared processor pool
    * VPN connection
    * Virtual tape library
5.	On the right-side panel, click **Add to estimate** to review the configuration.
6.	If you are not looged-in, choose **from catalog** in the **Add product to estimate** drop-down menu.
7.	Click **Save**.
8.	Click **View estimate** to view and take actions on them.


### Estimating a virtual server instance

| Storage tiers             	| **Optional**: Attach volumes to your estimate. You can choose from Tier 0, Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Fixed IOPs or a mix of these. \n 
You cannot add a separate boot volume estimation. Hence, you should enter the storage volume considering the boot volumes and data volume that you might need.|

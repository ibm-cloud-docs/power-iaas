The IBM Power Subscription plan can provision VMs with SAP BYOL or Linux BYOL images. The costs are based on a flat subscription rate and not on the metered instance usage. If you deploy VMs in your datacenter without ordering the IBM Power Subscription plan, the cost on your datacenter is based on the metered instance usage. When you register the infrastructure, if metered plan is selected, you cannot provision VMs with SAP images and charges are based on the instance usage.

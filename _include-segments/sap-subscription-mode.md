[{{site.data.keyword.on-prem}}]{: tag-red} The IBM Power Subscription plan can provision VMs with SAP bring your own license (BYOL) or Linux BYOL images. The costs are based on a flat subscription rate and not on the metered instance usage. If you deploy VMs in your data center without ordering the IBM Power Subscription plan, the costs are based on the metered instance usage. When you register the infrastructure, if the metered plan is selected, you cannot provision VMs with SAP images and the costs are based on the instance usage.

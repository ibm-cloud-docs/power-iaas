When you use SPPs, you pay for the maximum capacity of the SPP reserved cores. If a VM is assigned to the SPP, you are not billed for the cores that the VM uses. The cost of the cores that the VM uses are covered in the cost of the main core for SPP.

VMs might not use the reserved cores but they are considered for cost calculation because the reserved cores in SPP are exclusively reserved for your use.
{: note}

If a VM is assigned to the SPP, additional resources that are used by a VM are billed along with the cost of VM. Additional resources can include memory and license for operating systems or other workloads that are deployed in the VM.

# Creating an estimate for IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} resources
{: #creating-an-estimate}
{: help}
{: support}

Before you deploy a {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} with cloud resources such as virtual server instances, storage volumes, shared processor pools, virtual tape libraries, or dedicated hosts, it is important that you create an estimate to understand the associated costs. You can use the [cost estimator](https://cloud.ibm.com/power/estimate){: external} tool to estimate the cost of the {{site.data.keyword.powerSysFull}} resources before you deploy them in an IBM data center or in a {{site.data.keyword.on-prem-lc}}.
{: shortdesc}

With the cost estimator tool, you can customize the resource quantities based on your business requirement and view the estimated cost. You can use the cost estimator tool for:
- [Creating an estimation of {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} resources](#est-resources)
- [Adding, saving, and viewing an estimate](#adding-an-estimate)

## Creating and viewing an estimation of {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} resources
{: #est-resources}

You can create an estimate by specifying the parameters for your {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} resources and by specifying a projected growth rate. Based on your selection, you can view the estimated cost of your {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} resources in an IBM data center or in a {{site.data.keyword.on-prem-lc}}. You can connect with your IBM Business Partner or contact IBM to place your order.

You are not charged for creating an estimate. The resources that you estimate can be deployed only after a workspace is created.

##### Estimating a {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} instance with an {{site.data.keyword.ibmi-vst}}
{: #est-ibmi-vst}

A virtual software tier limits the size of the virtual machines (VMs) for a particular pricing tier, but the tiers can run on any system. The {{site.data.keyword.ibmi-vst}} is used for the software pricing of operating system (OS) and IBM i licensed program products (LPP). When you assign an {{site.data.keyword.ibmi-vst}} to an instance, the number of CPUs and the amount of memory that can be assigned to the instance is restricted by the {{site.data.keyword.ibmi-vst}}. For more information, see [Assigning an IBM i software tier to an IBM i Power Virtual Server instance](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-ibmi-vsw-tiers#ibmi-vsw-system-types).

You can create an estimate of the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} instance with an {{site.data.keyword.ibmi-vst}} before you deploy the instance. To assign an {{site.data.keyword.ibmi-vst}} to an IBM i {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} instance, meet the following prerequisites:

- IBM i image version is 7.3 or later
- VSN is assigned to the instance
- Machine type is IBM Power10 or later

The following table explains the fields that you can use to create a {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} instance with an IBM i software tier:

### Estimating {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} resources in a {{site.data.keyword.on-prem-lc}}
{: #on-prem-location-type}

You can create an estimate for {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} resources in a {{site.data.keyword.on-prem-lc}} where the physical infrastructure, including the IBM Power servers, are deployed and resides in the client's own data center, rather than in IBM's data centers.

If you select the **Location type** as **{{site.data.keyword.on-prem}}**, complete the following steps:

1. Specify the infrastructure requirements that include the machine type, number of systems, and storage capacity for your data center in the **Infrastructure configuration** section. The **Infrastructure overview** section displays the summary of the selected configuration. The pod size depends on the number of systems that you select including the total memory and the total number of cores that you plan to use in your data center.

    Currently, IBM Power S1122 (2U), IBM Power E1150 (4U), and IBM Power E1180 (12U) servers are supported by specific memory. Each server type is shipped with a fixed number of cores.

2. From the **Committed monthly spend** section, select the number of years from the **Contract commitment term** list. The **Committed monthly spend** value indicates the minimum monthly cost for your {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} pod.

    A longer contract commitment term reduces the minimum committed spend value. You can contact IBM to learn more about the possible savings with the commitment plans. Metered cost is determined based on the consumption and it is charged only when the consumption rate is greater than the minimum committed spend value.
    {: note}

3.  Click **Model consumption** to set the predicted consumption of the infrastructure configuration resources that you plan to use during the contract commitment term that you choose in the previous step. You can specify the predicted memory and core usage for each of the server types. You can also set the predicted storage capacity that you plan to use. After you set the predicted usage and reviewed the estimated metered (billing) cost, close the **Model metered consumption** window.

    The summary of estimated costs for the contract commitment years is displayed in the **Summary** panel based on your selection of predicted infrastructure resource usage. Metered consumption cost is only charged if the actual metered cost is greater than the **Minimum committed spend** value.

4.  Review the estimated cost in the **Summary** panel on the right side of the page. The estimated minimum cost includes the **Minimum committed spend** value and the billing charges, if any.

    The actual cost might increase based on your consumption rates.
    {: note}

5.  Click **Add to estimate** to create an estimate and export your configuration estimate. For instructions about creating an estimate, see [Creating an estimate](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-generating-an-estimate#creating-an-estimate).


## Adding, saving, and viewing an estimate
{: #adding-an-estimate}

When you create the estimate, you can create and export the configuration estimate by completing the following steps:

1. Click **Add to estimate** in the **Summary** panel of the **Estimate Cost** page. The **Estimate** panel is displayed.

2. To add the cost information to an existing estimate, select an estimate from the **Add product to estimate** list. Alternatively, to create a new estimate, you can click **Create a new estimate** > specify a name and an optional description for the estimate > Click **Create**.

3. In the **Estimate** window, click **Save** to save the product to the selected or created estimate.

4. Click **View estimate** to view an estimate of your {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} configuration.

5. Click **Download** to export the saved estimate as an XLSX, a CSV, or a PDF file.


## Contacting IBM to place an order
{: #contacting-ibm}

Share the downloaded estimate with your IBM Business Partner to start the ordering process. Initiate the discussion to plan for your infrastructure configuration, data center requirements, to learn about possible savings plans, or to place your order.

If you do not work with an IBM Business Partner, contact IBM through email or the contact number that is specified on the window.

Before you place the order for IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} Private Cloud, verify that the basic criteria to own a pod is met. For more information, see [Prerequisites for installing the pod](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-pre_installation_checklist).

# General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
{: #data-protection}

The GDPR seeks to create a harmonized data protection law framework across the European Union (EU) and aims to give citizens back the control of their personal data. The GDPR imposes strict rules on those hosting and *processing* personal data anywhere in the world. This regulation also introduces rules that relate to the free movement of personal data within and outside of the EU.

With the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://www.eugdpr.org/){: new_window}{: external}, {{site.data.keyword.powerSysFull}} clients can rely on the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} team's understanding and compliance with emerging data privacy standards and legislation. {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} clients can also rely in {{site.data.keyword.IBM}}'s wider ability to provide a comprehensive suite of solutions to assist businesses of all sizes with their own internal data governance requirements.

# Service security
{: #service-security}

## Physical and environmental security measures
{: #security-measures}

Physical security of our data centers is handled by our infrastructure providers: {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, AWS, and 21Vianet. All of these infrastructure providers hold externally audited certifications for their physical security. The {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} team will not be providing further details of the physical security controls in place at our data centers.

Physical security of the office locations that are used by our personnel is handled by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Corporate. Certification details and attestation reports (that is, ISO and SOC2) can be provided to the client upon request.

## Technical and organizational measures
{: #technical-measures}

Technical and Organizational Measures (TOMs) are employed by the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} service to ensure the security of personal data. {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} holds externally audited certifications for the controls it employs. Certification details and attestation reports (that is, ISO and SOC2) can be provided to the client upon request.

## Service access to data
{: #service-access-to-data}

{{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} operations and support staff have access to client data and can access it during routine operations. This access is only done as required to operate and support the service. Access is also limited to a **need to know** basis and is logged, monitored, and audited.

## Online retention of client data
{: #data-retention}

Client data is retained during the client's use of the service (until the client's contract termination or expiration) by default. Additionally, clients can define shorter retention periods for some of their data within the service to align with their own data organizational retention policies. All client data is removed from the online service **1 business day** after the client's contract termination or expiration.

## Backup retention of client data
{: #backup-retention}

The {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} service does not provide backups of client data.

## Destruction of client Data
{: #data-retention}

IBM policies require the removal of client data at their request and or termination of a service. The {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} service gives the client the ability to delete all online client data at their request or termination of the service. The secure destruction of all client data happens at *end of life* of the associated infrastructure or cloud service.

## Export of client Data
{: #data-export}

IBM contractually commits, as required by various industry and government regulations, that we will provide clients the capability to export their data, or that IBM will provide the client with export copies of their data upon request. The {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} service
gives clients the ability to export data on their own.

[On-premises]{: tag-red}

You can use system calculators to determine the system power load or the distributed floor load for your system.
* **Power calculators**: The [IBM Systems energy estimator](https://see.c8f8f055.public.multi-containers.ibm.com/see/EnergyEstimator){: external} is a web-based tool for estimating power requirements for IBM systems. This tool estimates typical power requirements (watts) for a specific system configuration under normal operating conditions.
* **Floor load calculator**: Use [Floor load calculator](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/v1/content/POWER6/iphdl/floorloadcalc.htm){: external} to determine the distributed load that a server, expansion unit, or migration tower places on a subfloor (for example, in a data center with a raised floor) or on an above-ground or nonraised floor structure.
* **Workload estimator**: The [IBM Workload estimator](https://ibm.biz/workload-estimator){: external} is a web-based sizing tool for IBM systems. You can use this tool to size a new system, to size an upgrade to an existing system, or to size a consolidation of several systems. For European power distributions that cannot support 30 amps single-phase, a 16 amps 3-Phase PDU power cord is substituted.

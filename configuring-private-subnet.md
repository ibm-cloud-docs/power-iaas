# Configuring and adding a private network subnet
{: #configuring-subnet}
{: help}
{: support}

You can configure a private network subnet when you create a IBM&reg; Power Systems&trade; Virtual Server. You must give your subnet a **Name** and specify a **Classless inter-domain routing (CIDR)**. When you specify a CIDR, the **Gateway**, **IP range**, and **DNS server** are automatically populated. You must use CIDR notation when you choose the IP ranges for your private network subnet. CIDR notation is defined in [RFC 1518](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1518){: external} and [RFC 1519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1519){: external}.
{: shortdesc}

```shell
<IPv4 address>/<number>
```
{: screen}

For example, `192.168.100.14/24` represents the IPv4 address, `192.168.100.14`, and its associated routing prefix `192.168.100.0`, or equivalently, its subnet mask `255.255.255.0` (which has 24 leading 1 bits).

The first IP address is always reserved for the gateway in all data centers. The second and third IP addresses are reserved for gateway high-availability (HA) in only the *WDC04* colo. The subnet address and subnet broadcast address are reserved in both colos.
{: important}

To create a new subnet, complete the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [IBM Cloud Portal](https://cloud.ibm.com){: external}.

2. Select the menu icon and select **Resource List**.

3. Click the arrow next to **Services**.

4. Select the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} workspace you'd like to assign a subnet.

5. Click **Subnets** in the left navigation pane, then **Add subnet**.

6. Enter a name for the subnet, CIDR value (for example: 192.168.100.14/24), gateway number (for example: 192.168.100.15), and the IP range values for the subnet.

7. You must provide the **DNS server** value.
    A **DNS server** value of `9.9.9.9` might not be reachable if you don't have a public IP. This can cause the LPAR to hang during startup. Go with the default DNS server value of `127.0.0.1` to avoid this issue. As of now, you can add up to 20 DNS servers. The DNS IP addresses must be separated by commas.

8. You can also attach a primary and redundant cloud connection to the subnet to set up high availability. For more information on high availability, see [Setting up high availability over cloud connections](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-cloud-connections#ha-availability-cloud-connections).

9. Click **Create subnet**.

You can also edit an existing subnet by clicking the subnet in the table. You can attach or detach cloud connections to each of the subnets in the **Attached cloud connections** section. 

You can also create and configure a private network subnet by using the IBM CLI. Use the following command to create a private network subnet:

```shell
ibmcloud pi network-create-private NETWORK_NAME --cidr-block CIDR --ip-range "startIP-endIP[,startIP-endIP]" [--dns-servers "DNS1 DNS2"] [--gateway GATEWAY] [--json]
```

## Networking considerations
{: #networking-considerations}

You must route {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} private network subnets over {{site.data.keyword.BluDirectLink}} to allow connectivity between {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} network. This step is part of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link configuration.

When you have cloud connections or VPNaaS configured, you can create private networks automatically by attaching private network subnet to cloud connections.
However, when you need a private network communication between the two {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} instances and not from/to IBM Cloud network, you must open a [support ticket](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-getting-help-and-support) against {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} to configure such private network configuration.

If your private subnets are routed over a Direct Link, you must make sure that your {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} has a route to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. The default route might not be set up to route traffic to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} subnets, which are typically of the form, *10.xx.xx.xx*. Similarly, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} network-based x86 virtual switch interfaces (VSI) and other hosts might require an IP route to connect to a {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}.

The gateway for {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} is also the gateway for the local subnet that is routed to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} over {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link. The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} x86 VSI might need a static route to {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} subnets as well. The gateway for this route is the same as the gateway for the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network.

For more information, see tutorial on [IBM Power Systems Virtual Server integration with x86-based workloads](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/downloads/power-iaas-tutorials/PowerVS_and_x86_Integration_Tutorial_v1.pdf){: external}.

## Using CIDR notation
{: #cidr-notation}

You must not use an IP range outside of the ranges that are defined by [RFC 1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918){: external} (`10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, or `192.168.0.0/16`) for a subnet. The instances that are attached to that subnet might not be able to reach parts of the public internet.

If you are using an IP range outside of the ranges that are defined by [RFC 1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918){: external} (`10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, or `192.168.0.0/16`) for a subnet you must use IANA assigned IPs and GRE tunneling. For more information see [Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunneling](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-configuring-power#gre-tunneling). PowerVS assigns IPs as Internal IP from the prefix 192.168.0.0/16 to your accounts for Public Network access. Once a public subnet is assigned, you cannot use those IPs for private networks.

The following networks are filtered out and are not accepted: 10.0.0.0/14, 10.200.0.0/14, 10.198.0.0/15, and 10.254.0.0/16.
{: note}

The number after the slash represents the bit length of the subnet mask. As a result, the smaller the number after the slash, the **more** IP addresses you are allocating. The following table lists the number of available addresses in a subnet (based on its specified CIDR block size):

| CIDR block size | Available IP addresses (WDC04,WDC06) | Available IP addresses (non-WDC) |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
|      /22        |        1019                    |          1021                      |
|      /23        |         507                    |           509                      |
|      /25        |         123                    |           125                      |
|      /26        |          59                    |            61                      |
|      /27        |          27                    |            29                      |
|      /28        |          11                    |            13                      |

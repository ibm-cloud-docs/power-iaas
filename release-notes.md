  {: note}

- **Introduction of {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} S1022 processor**
: The Power10 S1022 (9105-22A) is now available in `WDC07` data center. As we progress, additional data centers will be made available.

  SAP Netweaver is not certified for use with S1022 systems, making them suitable exclusively for non-production workloads.
  {: note}

- **IBM i 7.3 service extension pricing**
: Effective 1 October 2023, IBM i 7.3 on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} is at end of normal support and will be in service extension. Service extension pricing will be automatically added to the IBM i charge for IBM i 7.3 usage.

- **Addition of New Global Replication Service data center pair**
: {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} have expanded the Global Replication Service (GRS) capabilities by adding a new data center pair - `DAL13` and `WDC04`. This enhancement is currently available on the Tier 1 storage support within the GRS framework. See, the documentation: [Locations that support global replication service](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-getting-started-GRS#locations-GRS).

## June 2023
{: #jun-2023}

-  The {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} enhances the management of stock images in the backend. This enhancement eliminates identical versions (copies) of stock images and improves the performance of copying a stock image in your account through the use of an image reference. Find more information in the [FAQ doc page](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-power-iaas-faqs#stock-image-copy-improve).

  We are currently rolling out the feature to eliminate stock image copies in all data centers in phases. If your data center has already received the update, you will notice that the export option for stock images is no longer available because you are using the reference of the stock image.

- IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} is sequentially rolling out Power Edge Router (PER) solution that is currently available in `DAL10` datacenter.
  
  PER improves network communication across different parts of IBM network. See, [Getting Started with Power Edge Router](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-per) for more information.
